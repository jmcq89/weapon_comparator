# weapon_comparator

# To do:

* Define some weapon profiles
    - Added effects for things like rail rifles? Gauss ? etc.

* Build a weapon comparison tool 
    * for the given weapons compute the array for expected unsaved wounds and expected damage
    * give the best weapon for each S/T and some summaries
    * give the rankings for each S/T

* Define some units
    * Can be used to generate a weighted average
        * or to select the best weapon versus this foe
